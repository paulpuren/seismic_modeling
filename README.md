## Highlights

- Present a new PINN model for seismic wave modeling in semi-infinite domain without the need for labeled data.
- Introduce the absorbing boundary conditions into the network as a soft regularizer for handling truncated boundaries.
- Leverage a sequential training strategy via temporal domain decomposition to improve the scalability of the PINNs.
- Design a novel surrogate modeling strategy to account for parametric loading, which estimates the wave propagation in semi-infinite domain given the seismic loading at different locations.
